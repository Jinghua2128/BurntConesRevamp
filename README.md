Design Rationale— Burnt Cones Revamped Website

We designed the Burnt Cones revamped website’s visual design and UX to closely reflect its brand as a modern artisan gelato and coffee boutique. This was done with some of their brand traits in mind — handcrafted quality with contemporary flair.

1. Typography & Text Hierarchy

- Clean and legible fonts to give the website a premium yet accessible feel
- Bold and structured headlined to suggest confidence and craftmanship
- Readable and balanced body text to create a smooth visual rhythm across sections
- Clear typographic hierarchy to help users quickly understand content priority — brand statement, product offerings, then locations.

In brand design theory, font choice actively contributes to brand personality and perception (almost like the “spokesperson” of the brand). A font that matches the brand enhances how users interpret the brand’s character and quality.

2. Colour Palette & Tone

- Soft, earthy, and muted colours (ie brown and white) are used to provoke the sense of warmth + artisanal feeling of the brand in consumers. 
- These colours also evoke a premium, cozy, and sophisticated feeling rather than loud or overly vibrant colours which aligns with the artisanal branding instead of a playful dessert chain vibe.
- In food & drink UI design, colour influences appetite and emotional response — pastel or gentle hues often signal freshness and craft.
- Limited and thoughtful colour palette to support brand recognition and help maintain consistency

3. Layout & Visual Structure

The layout follows a clear vertical flow:
   1. Main statement
   2. seasonal flavours
   3. locations
   4. social contact

Each section is spaced to allow comfortable reading and scanning without overwhelming the user.

This content hierarchy prioritizes what users care about first— what the product is, what flavours they can try, and how to find it, before moving into social and contact action.

4. Navigation & UX

- Fixed navigation bar at the top with simple anchor links helps users jump between content segments easily
- Images accompanying flavour descriptions and locations improve the experience by adding visuals with key information.

5. Brand Personality & Intent

The visual and UX choices were made to communicate a crafted, authentic, and social brand personality:

- Craftsmanship: Through clean typography and balanced spacing, the site feels made with care, matching the boutique gelato narrative (“Handcrafted Excellence”).
- Premium Yet Approachable: Muted natural tones read as curated rather than overly playful or gimmicky which is ideal for a boutique targeting both indie lovers and casual visitors.
- Social & Experience-Driven: Including the #BurntConesMoments gallery and clear social icons (IG, TikTok, Facebook) to encourage the brand to be shared visually and socially.

In brand design practice, consistency in colour, typography, and messaging is essential for brand recognition and emotional connection. When these elements align, consumers are more likely to form lasting impressions and engage repeatedly.
